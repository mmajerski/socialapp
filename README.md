### Social-like app

This app was being created quite spontaneously so certain parts can be not consistent:)

##

**Stack**

Basically React, Redux and Firebase.  
Some Google services like Google maps or autocomplete.  
Also Formik was used quite heavily here.  
Semantic-UI-React was used for UI.  
For dropping images, cropping images, displaying map, dealing with autocomplete I used third-party libraries.
